# Angular Tour of Heroes

I followed the [Tour of Heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial), and pushed it a bit further by building a [Spring REST API](https://github.com/bhubr/angular-toh-spring-server) to persist/serve the data it uses.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
